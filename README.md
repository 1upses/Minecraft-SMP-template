- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

# Installation

- Install pyjson5.

```bash
pip install pyjson5
```

- launch ```update_files.py```
```bash
python "./udpate_files.py"
```

# Usage

- Windows -> double click on ```run.bat``` and enjoy
- Linux -> ```bash run.sh```

If you want to modify the plugins, you can do so by editing ```settings.json```, deleting the plugins in the plugins folder, and running the ```update_files.py``` script again

You can also copy ```settings.json``` and ```update_files.py``` to your personnal server, to then modify ```settings.json``` to your liking, and get a script that will update everything in your server all by itself -> also works with modded servers
